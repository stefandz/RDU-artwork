## Fireflies

Generative firefly code for a 150 x 20 wall of Dotstar LED strips installed in St Thomas' Hospital Rare Diseases Unit by [BAT Studio](http://www.batstudio.co.uk/). Heavily influenced by Nicky Case's excellent [firefly simulator](http://ncase.me/fireflies/). Click the image below for more about the project.
